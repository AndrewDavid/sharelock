When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, which may include Personal Information.</p><p>If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the information that we have collected, including Personal Information, would be transferred along with our other business assets.</p><p>We may disclose your information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose your information when we have reason to believe that someone is or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of the Services, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p><h3>How We Protect Your Information</h3><p>Auth0 is SOC-2 compliant and will continue to be SOC 2 compliant. Auth0 conducts vulnerability scans and audits of its servers and networks at least annually.</p><p>Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable.  We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet.

We have committed to resolve any complaints by European Union and Swiss citizens relating to this Privacy Policy, which cannot be resolved directly with our company, through the Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc.’s Safe Harbor Privacy Dispute Resolution Procedures.</p><p>If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact us as set forth in the "How to Contact Us" section below.
